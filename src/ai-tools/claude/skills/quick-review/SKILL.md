# Code Review

1. Inspect the diff and surrounding code.
2. Look for correctness bugs, regressions, missing tests, unsafe input handling, secret exposure, and unnecessary complexity.
3. Prioritize findings by severity and cite file paths and relevant lines.
4. Do not modify files during a review unless the user asks.
5. If no issues are found, say so and mention what was not verified.
